# Documentation

Here is the documentation of the project, I will explain here each choice made. 

To start the documentation, the first choice to make is how to separate the project in namespaces. I choose to make 4 namespaces :

- **siem** for all components linked to the siem splunk
- **security** for managing logs and security
- **incident-management** for managing alerts and incidents
